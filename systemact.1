.SH CONFIGURATION
.P
The whole reason of systemact is to have flexibility and provide a backend command for a logout menu
that works across multiple setups and software stacks, for that purpose many of the actions are done
through configurable commands so that the users can specify whatever command they want for their
setup without having to hardcode it anywhere in the software that is actually providing the ui, tho
systemact will try to default to widely supported commands if the user doesn't specify custom ones.
.P
For the purpose of working with multiple software stacks systemact defines the
.B $ctl
variable that points to a seat control command,
.B systemctl
or
.B loginctl
which are provided by systemd and elogind respectively, the ctl command is determined by systemact at
runtime by checking the symlink in
.B /sbin/init
if it contains the string
.B systemd
then systemctl will be used, otherwise it will use loginctl.
.P
It is important to note that systemact does NOT do any validation for the custom commands as there
is no easy way to test those, so in that case whatever goes wrong with those is the user's fault.
