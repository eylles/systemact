# the logout command
# by default systemact will check if you use systemd to call systemctl, if not then it will default
# to elogind's loginctl, whichever ctl command is use will be passed:
#     terminate-session ${XDG_SESSION_ID}.
# so internally it could be loginctl terminate-session ${XDG_SESSION_ID}
# make sure whatever logout command you use is on your PATH and works before setting it here as
# systemact will make no check nor comprobation whatsoever for your custom command
#logoutcmd=""

# the lock command
# internally it is defined as $ctl lock-session ${XDG_SESSION_ID}, which is to use whichever the
# correct ctl command (loginctl or systemctl) is for your system and pass the lock-session and
# session id, no idea how this is handled internally but may be talking to the
# org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver dbus interface, in that case if your screen locker/saver does not
# implement support for that dbus interface a popular alternative is to use xdg-screensaver lock
#lockcmd=""
